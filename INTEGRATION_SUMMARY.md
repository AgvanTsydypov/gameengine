## 💡 How It Works

### User Flow:

4. Clicks **"₿ Pay with Crypto"**
5. Redirected to NOWPayments invoice page
6. Chooses cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.)

### Technical Flow:
```
payment.html (JS)
    ↓ fetch('/nowpayments_create')
app.py:nowpayments_create()
    ↓ nowpayments_manager.create_invoice()
NOWPayments API
    ↓ returns invoice_url
User completes payment
    ↓ NOWPayments webhook
app.py:nowpayments_webhook()
    ↓ verifies signature
    ↓ supabase_manager.add_credits() ✅
User gets credits!
```
